<h1>Publishing models in your own HTML page</h1>

<p>The Systo approach allows for 4 areas of creativeness:
    <ol>
        <li>You can create a model;</li>
        <li>You can create a web page to make a model (or many models) available to others;</li>
        <li>You can create a widget capable of displaying some aspect of a model or the results of running a model;</li>
        <li>You can create a new diagrammatic language.</li>
    </ol>
</p>

<p>This web page deals with the second of these 4 topics: making a web page for a model.</p>

<p>You may already be familiar with the idea of seeing models on the web, and running models in your browser  for example, <a href="">isee's NetSim</a>, <a href="">Forio</a>, and <a href="">InsightMaker</a>.
