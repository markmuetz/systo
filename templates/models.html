<h3>Models</h3>

<p>This page links through to various model collections hosted on systo.org.    Currently (April 2014) these are organised in a number of model galleries, as set out in the following table.</p>  
<table style="border:none">
    <tr>
        <th>Gallery</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td width="200px"><a href="modelgallery/modelgallery01.html">Model gallery 1</a>:<br/>Basic System Dynamics models</th>
        <td>These models are generic System Dynamics models, intended to introduce the newcomer to basic building blocks for constructing System Dynamics models.   Entries include single-stock models with simple inflows and outflows (for example, constant flows or flows proportional to the stock level).</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td width="200px"><a href="modelgallery/modelgallery02.html">Model gallery 2</a>:<br/>Population dynamics</th>
        <td>One- and two-species population models.</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td width="200px"><a href="modelgallery/modelgallery03.html">Model gallery 3</a>:<br/>Crop and forest models</th>
        <td>Process-based models of crop growth and forest dynamics.</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td width="200px"><a href="modelgallery/modelgallery04.html">Model gallery 4</a>:<br/>Simple world models</th>
        <td>Models of world dynamics, including human aspects.</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td width="200px"><a href="modelgallery/modelgallery05.html">Model gallery 5</a>:<br/>Epidemics</th>
        <td>Basic (non-spatial) models of the spread of a disease within a population.</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td width="200px"><a href="modelgallery/modelgallery06.html">Model gallery 6</a>:<br/>Models from Andy Ford's <i>Modeling the Environment</i></th>
